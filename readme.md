# nnGo - Neural Network Library
<p>
    Neural Network library with no dependencies, has it's own Matrix implementation and a 3 layered 
    (input, hidden, output) Dense Network.
</p>

<br />

## Pre - Requisites
   Make sure you have `GO` Installed.

<br />
 
## About library
The `nnGo` folder in this repo holds two files named, Matrix.go and NN.go. Matrix.go contains all required 
components that should be their to generate and perform operations on Matrices, where as the NN.go file 
contains code that utilizes the Matrix implementation to provide a 3 layered fully connected Dense Neural Network.

* Documentation: [godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/sarthakpranesh/nnGo)

<br />

## Testing The Library
1. git clone https://github.com/sarthakpranesh/nnGo.git
2. cd nnGo
3. That's it hurray! You can checkout the `examples` subdirectory as a playground to test the library out!!!

<br />

## Examples
1. [Twitter Hate Speech Classification](https://github.com/sarthakpranesh/nnGo/blob/master/examples/Twitter%20hate%20speech%20classification/main.go)
2. [MNIST](https://github.com/sarthakpranesh/nnGo/blob/master/examples/MNIST/mnist.go)
3. [XOR](https://github.com/sarthakpranesh/nnGo/blob/master/examples/xor.go)

## Looking for help
<p>
    Currently I only have Three example ( XOR , MNIST and Twitter hate speech classification ) implemented using this library and only two activation function supported.
    I would love if anyone of you can help me by implementing more examples or define different activation functions in 
    this Toy library. Also looking for improving the existing code quality.
